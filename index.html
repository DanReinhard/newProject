        <h3>a summary</h3>
        <br/><h2>Part One: Normal...-ish</h2>
        <p>Born in the summer of '93, to my parents--one a Californian beach bum turned<br/>
        computer scientist and the other an artist turned stay-at-home mother--in the<br/>
        in the city of Orem, UT, I feel safe to say that my life has been ordinary.<br/>
        Very, extremely, painfully ordinary.</p>
        <p>I grew up with nothing but sisters for the first 14 years of my life. There is<br/>
        a little brother in my life now but, unfortunately for him, he grew up not with two parents<br/>
        but with seven. He has almost been more like a nephew to me but I still call him brother.</p>
        <p>Ordinary things to talk about but again I have been a rather ordinary person most my life</p>
        <p>My interests include piano, stained glass, whistling (to the point of annoyance or so my <br/>
        girlfriend tells me), screaming into the void, and touching every pole as I walk down the street.<br/>
        Are you bored yet...<span>No? Well then. Onto round two.</span> My passion, yes there is a difference<br/>
        between interest and passion, is to make people laugh. You know you've done something right when you are able<br/>
        to make the whole room hold their sides as if their insides were falling out. If their insides are<br/>
        falling out, I suspect you've done something wrong.

        <p><pre>Note: Should you not find this humorous, I suggest acquiring five cents and purchasing some taste.&gt;_&lt;</pre></p>
        <p>To be continued...</p>
